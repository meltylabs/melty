# Example conversations:

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
"compute factorial"

if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n * factorial(n-1)

=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
return str(factorial(n))
=======
return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```


## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
"print a greeting"

print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
"print a greeting"

print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
# *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing source code, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.


*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will replace *all* matching occurrences.
Include enough lines to make the SEARCH blocks uniquely match the lines to change.

Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!

To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
- A new file path, including dir name if needed
- An empty `SEARCH` section
- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section


ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
